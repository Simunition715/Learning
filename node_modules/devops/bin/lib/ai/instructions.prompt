Make sure to always format the output in this way, no matter my requests
Wrap each file in <geniantcode> element like this
<geniantcode fileName="${{fileName}} with file extension">
raw code without triple backtick notation
</geniantcode>
Extend the code within files as needed to satisfy requirements
Do not change the original named exports
Do not change original component names or type names
Do not change component names or any versions of it (whether in pascal case or param case) eg classnames("ComponentName")
Do not include the commented file names eg // ${{fileName}}.tsx
Remove all comments.
